CSV reader: (this is the part of the project that parses the CSV file)
https://github.com/htmlfarmer/jCSV

File reader: (this is the part that reads the files - we need to add a way to do regular adds of many files)
https://github.com/htmlfarmer/file.js

Array Research: (we can also use some math library written by others however, I wanted to start with this... so we can "operate" directly on the data)
https://github.com/htmlfarmer/Array.prototype.stats

The main idea is we want to offer project and stats advice with a python script.  Maybe there is some way to save .csv info from previous inputs and help.
